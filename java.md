### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
The constructor is a special method of a class that allows us to instantiate that class. Every class has a default constructor, but we can create more specific ones, which take in parameters. Constructors are used when creating a new instannce of something by using the 'new' keyword and the Constructor() of the object.
